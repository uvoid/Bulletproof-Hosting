This is a guide on how to host a botnet in 2022 without getting banned!


Now this title is somewhat clickbait, yes you will be getting banned, A lot.
But that doesnt mean you have to lose all your progress of zmaping day and night to
get that 50 bot mark. There are ways around it.

Requirements (minimum):
1x 1g RAM 1 Core VPS Server
1x 2g RAM 1 Core VPS Server

So now that you know the bare minimum requirements, lets get into why you need 2 servers, and where to get them.

1G Ram server - This will be your c2 server. most hosts do not ban or evem find out if you're hosting a c2
This server is dedicated ONLY to your c2, so dont worry too much about the specs
I get my c2 servers from 100up hosting. cheap and ddos protected

2g Ram server - this is the server where you will host your bins and use your echo loader.
this server does NOT have to be 2g ram and can be as low as 500mb if you arent going to be echo loading on it.
Now heres the catch, this server will be banned within a week of using it. your bins will be all over spamhaus and your
host will have no choice. but this server getting banned does NOT mean you lose your bots.
All your infected bots are already connected to your c2 server. so simply buy a new server and setup your bins again!
the whole point of this server is to host the binaries the bots download so losing it only means no new bots until you gew a new one working.

i get my host servers from private-hosting.eu. they are cheap ($5 a month) and slow to ban. you have a good week before
they deal with your abuse reports
